--In a different season, would the earned premiums change assuming the same utilisation?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the premium calculation includes weather-based adjustments 
like a 120 hike for rainy and windy days, then yes, earned premiums would change in a different season
even with the same utilisationâ€”because the frequency of rainy and windy days can vary by season.

In seasons with more rainy/windy days, more trips will have the 120 premium applied,
increasing total earned premiums.
In drier, calmer seasons, fewer trips will be subject to the premium hike, so total earned premiums will be lower.
If your premium calculation does not depend on weather (i.e., no adjustment for rain/wind), 
then earned premiums would remain the same for the same utilisation, regardless of season.
